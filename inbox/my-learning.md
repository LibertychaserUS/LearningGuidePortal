# Intent

Signed-in My Learning overview: entitled or preview-started course cards and unique Learning Point progress.

# In scope

- ML-FR-004 Course cards on the My Learning overview.
- ML-FR-007 Unique Learning Point progress 0–100.

# Out of scope

- Payment (see `inbox/payment.md`).
- Login page itself (see `inbox/login.md`). Session gate is AUTH-06.

# User cases

1. A signed-in user opens My Learning and sees their own progress, not someone else's.

# Notes

Excerpt only. Do not vendor the docx. Suite is armed. New BF suites stay draft until a human arms them. Ids come from existing unit tests, not a second numbering system. HTTP I/O for the signed-out leaf, post-purchase overview, and expired entitlement lives in `tests/io/my-learning.test.ts`.
