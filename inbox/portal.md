# Intent

Published course pages for tourists: store identity, syllabus lock or preview, and CTA bands. Not a full Portal PRD dump.

# In scope

- UC-PORTAL-1 Course page primitives come from the product store.

# Out of scope

- Payment checkout (see `inbox/payment.md`).
- My Learning overview cards (see `inbox/my-learning.md`).
- Hitting production hosts.

# User cases

1. A tourist opens a published course and sees previewable versus locked lessons from the store.

# Notes

Excerpt only. Suite is armed. New BF suites stay draft until a human arms them. Id is copied from `UC-PORTAL-course-page-primitives.test.ts`. HTTP I/O for published-only catalogue, tourist access, and unpublished slug lives in `tests/io/portal.test.ts`.
