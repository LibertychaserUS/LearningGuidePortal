# Phase 1：发布和上线运行手册

## LGTeacher Backoffice Integration Release

The integration extends the existing backoffice and learner routes; do not deploy a second teacher frontend/backend. The source mapping, access rules and media limits are in [lgteacher-integration.md](lgteacher-integration.md).

1. Back up the existing product aggregate and private S3 prefix. No source account/COS data migration or additional table is required. Preserve the added author assignments, catalogue, structured contents and archived sections when restoring a backup.
2. Keep the current PostgreSQL/S3 VFS configuration and least-privilege application role. Authenticated course-media responses use the existing application origin; do not make the bucket public or configure public CDN caching for `/api/course-media/*`.
3. Run `npm run test:unit`, `npm run test:auth`, `npm run test:payment`, and `npm run build`. After the build, run `LGTEACHER_BUILD_READY=1 node --import tsx --require ./scripts/register-tsconfig-paths.cjs scripts/test-lgteacher-complete.ts`. The browser runner uses disposable local data and refuses an occupied test port.
4. Promote through the existing CI/CD workflow and verify the actual target environment: operator and assigned-teacher access, save/reload, private upload/preview, publish, public lesson, entitled playback, and archive/restore. Operator-only account assignment grants teacher status only to a verified active existing account. Payment/order permissions do not change.
5. If rollback is necessary, retain the full aggregate and media objects. Older code cannot edit structured content safely; suspend authoring until the compatible version is restored. Do not flatten rich content or discard archived IDs to make an older build work.

The merge's local browser tests do not verify the live AWS IAM/S3 configuration or external login/payment providers. Multipart media is limited to 25 MiB; large-file tickets, transcoding and malware scanning are not included.

邮箱注册在 PPE/PROD 必须配置 `EMAIL_VERIFICATION_REQUIRED=1`、`SES_FROM_EMAIL`、`AWS_REGION` 和使用 HTTPS 的 `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`。冒烟测试必须确认待激活账号不能登录、验证链接只能成功使用一次，并且重新发送后旧链接失效。

## 1. 环境

### Password reset mail in DEV/SIT/UAT/production

- Configure `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` as the externally reachable application origin. Mail links use this origin; localhost links must be opened on the machine running the application.
- Configure SMTP (`SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASS`, optionally `SMTP_FROM`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_SECURE`) or SES (`SES_FROM_EMAIL`, `AWS_REGION` and AWS credentials/role with send permission). Configured delivery is used in every environment, including DEV. Presence of configuration does not establish successful provider delivery.
- Without configured delivery, SIT/UAT/PPE/PROD requests fail visibly with 503 `email_unavailable`; DEV returns 200 and sends nothing. There is no development preview link: `LOCAL_PASSWORD_RESET_PREVIEW` is not read and the API never returns `resetUrl`. To follow a reset link locally, configure SMTP (`SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASS`) or SES.
- Run the password-reset project in `playwright.auth.config.ts`, the bilingual `tests/e2e/password-reset.spec.ts`, and `npm run build`. Automated mail tests replace the transport and do not send real messages.
- Smoke test with an authorised test mailbox: submit from password sign-in, confirm the check-email page and cooldown, receive the message, follow the link, reset, sign in and return to the original URL. Verify reissue invalidates the previous link, expired/used tokens fail, and old sessions are revoked. Check both locales and spam folders. No real mailbox delivery or Figma acceptance is implied by automated tests.

| 环境 | 用途 | 数据 | 发布方式 |
|---|---|---|---|
| DEV | 开发人员联调 | 测试数据，可重置 | pull request 合并后自动部署 |
| SIT | 系统集成和支付测试 | 固定集成数据，Stripe test mode | DEV smoke 通过后发布 |
| UAT | 客户验收 | 脱敏验收数据，Stripe test mode | 版本候选人工批准 |
| PPE/PROD | 生产预演和正式站点 | 生产数据，Stripe live mode 仅在批准后打开 | 受控发布窗口 |

每个环境都是一个 AWS App Runner 服务，运行同一个 Docker image；配置通过 App Runner environment variables 和 Secrets Manager 注入。不要用代码分支复制业务逻辑。

## 2. Cloud 配置

- **Containers**：Docker image 启动 `next start`，监听 App Runner 提供的 `PORT`（当前配置为 8080）。
- **Database**：RDS PostgreSQL；生产只允许应用安全组访问；migration 由发布流程执行。
- **S3**：保存 avatar、course media、source material、KS 文件；bucket private；应用只生成短期 signed URL。
- **Network**：App Runner 通过 VPC Connector 访问 RDS；RDS 不公开暴露；S3、Stripe、Google、WeChat、OpenRouter 使用出站 HTTPS。
- **Security Strategy**：Secrets Manager 保存 `DATABASE_URL`、`STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`、`STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`、OAuth secrets、`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`、session secret；代码仓库和浏览器不保存 secret。
- **Monitor**：CloudWatch 记录 request error、latency、App Runner instance、database connection、payment webhook failure；不记录密码、卡信息、OAuth code 或完整 prompt/学生隐私内容。
- **Message Queue**：Phase 1 不单独部署队列；只有确有异步需求的邮件/通知才使用 database outbox，发送失败可重试。

## 3. CI/CD

### Stripe lookup-key rollout

- Set `PAYMENT_MODE=stripe`; keep each `STRIPE_PRICE_*` value as its Stripe lookup key. All eight mapped Prices must be active, licensed recurring USD Prices; six months means `month/6`, one year means `year/1` or `month/12`. A monthly Price is rejected for a yearly selection.
- With PostgreSQL, apply `db/migrations/009_product_payment_keys.sql` before deploying this version. Product writers now serialize the existing JSON aggregate and commit provider identity uniqueness in the same database transaction. Back up the aggregate first; this migration does not rewrite existing user or purchase records.
- Run `npm run test:auth`, `npm run test:payment`, and `npm run build`. Then run `node scripts/verify-stripe-checkout.mjs` with test credentials: it uses a disposable local store, creates and expires unpaid Checkout sessions, validates all available choices, and captures bilingual Pricing screenshots. It refuses live keys and does not submit a card.
- Configure the target endpoint `/api/payment/webhook` for Checkout completion/async success/async failure/expiry, invoice paid/failed, and subscription updated/deleted. Stripe CLI forwarding uses its own signing secret. Verify delivery and retry using the actual endpoint; test helpers alone do not verify deployed webhook configuration.
- Complete a real Stripe sandbox payment, renewal failure/recovery, cancellation, and Category-to-Everything upgrade before promotion. Check Order, Subscription and Entitlement, both locales, no-email WeChat users, and webhook-before/after-browser-return. The return page refreshes pending state but never grants access itself.
- Upgrades retain the existing one-time difference collection and change the original recurring subscription only after verified payment, with no proration or new subscription. Source and target must use the same Stripe interval/count so the renewal anchor is preserved.
- The remote sandbox verification records the Science annual lookup key correction; see `stripe-sandbox.md`. Revalidate the current catalogue before each release.

```text
GitHub pull request / push to main
  -> Verify (typecheck / lint / unit / integration / build) — tests only
  -> Deploy to App Runner on push to main (DEV www + admin)
  -> smoke: health, auth, course, quote, Stripe test webhook, entitlement
  -> Deploy SIT is workflow_dispatch only (never on push)
```

每次发布记录：git SHA、Docker image digest、database migration、环境、批准人、回滚 image。禁止在 App Runner 控制台直接改代码或手工执行生产 SQL。

## 4. 上线前必须完成

1. 四个环境的 App Runner、RDS、S3、Secrets Manager、CloudWatch 配置已逐项核对。
2. Domain、TLS、trusted origins、Google/WeChat callback 和 SES sender 已验证。
3. Stripe test mode 已完成成功、失败、取消、重复 webhook、乱序 webhook、全额 refund、异常订单 Resynchronise Payment。
4. 真实 plan、term、currency、税务规则、business timezone 和 trial 窗口已由业务确认。
5. `/my-learning/*`、`/learn/:course_id`、AI Tutor、Expired、Payment Grace、reset password 和中英文切换已通过 UAT。
6. 1–7 October 中国国庆假期不做 PPE/PROD 数据库变更或正式发布；release candidate 要么在假期前完成，要么 8 October 后执行。

正式发布前还必须运行 `npm run preflight:production`。如果 `/api/health/config` 返回 `ready: false`，不得把该 App Runner 服务当作生产站点开放购买或登录。生产环境必须使用真实 Google、WeChat、Stripe、SES 和 PostgreSQL/S3 配置；`LOCAL_SOCIAL_LOGIN=1`、`PAYMENT_MODE=demo` 或 `STORAGE_BACKEND=local` 均为阻断项。

## 5. 回滚

### WeChat login smoke test

- Mandatory email binding supersedes the earlier no-email Session acceptance checks below. Newly created and existing unbound WeChat users must receive a binding prompt before Purchase/My Learning. Check that direct protected API requests fail while unbound.
- Configure SMTP/SES and the trusted `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` in DEV/SIT/UAT/production. Use an authorised mailbox to verify delivery, 24-hour validity, 60-second resend, changing email, invalidation of old links, ownership conflicts, and successful duplicate clicks. Confirm userId and prior orders/subscriptions remain unchanged.
- Verify the email link in the original browser and in a different browser: original session becomes usable; another browser is prompted to sign in with WeChat and receives no session from the binding endpoint. Original waiting page refreshes after binding. Check locale and returnTo continuity, sign-out, interruption and resumption.
- Run authentication tests, bilingual binding browser tests, and build. Automated transport tests do not prove mailbox delivery. Record real QR/mail smoke and Figma acceptance before rollout.

- In WeChat Open Platform, confirm the website application is approved for website login and its authorised domain is the hostname only, for example `www.ilovelearningguide.com`.
- Use the configured HTTPS origin for both the login page and `/api/auth/wechat/callback`; set `LOCAL_SOCIAL_LOGIN=0`. The application sends the full callback URL to WeChat at runtime.
- Scan the QR code with a real WeChat account, approve access, confirm the browser returns to the requested page, confirm a session cookie is issued, and confirm the new user has no fabricated email address.
- `configured` health status checks presence of credentials, not provider acceptance; this real QR test remains mandatory.
- Run `npm run test:auth` and `npm run build` before deploying. Tests use fake provider responses and isolated temporary stores, never real credentials.
- On the target domain, scan and confirm: first sign-in creates one student Account, repeated sign-in retains userId, and `/api/auth/me` accepts the Session even when email is absent. Check both locales and returnTo from Purchase/My Learning.
- Cancel/expire the QR flow, retry, and verify that failures clear the temporary cookie without issuing a Session. Verify disabled accounts cannot sign in and expired/missing Entitlement still denies protected course access.
- Test paid and trial Checkout with an absent email; no placeholder address is sent. Do not treat a Checkout contact email as verified application email.
- Legacy subjects migrate lazily on successful login; back up product data before rollout. Do not roll back to code that requires verified email for all Sessions after no-email accounts exist. Prefer a forward fix or a tested compatibility build; preserve Orders and learning records.

- 应用错误：把 App Runner 指回上一个已验证 image digest。
- 数据库错误：先停止继续发布，按 migration 的反向操作或备份恢复方案处理；不得直接删除生产表。
- Stripe/Entitlement 错误：停止新 checkout，保留 webhook 接收，修复后按 Stripe 当前对象重新同步；不得手工在页面上“补开权限”。
