# Phase 1：七份 PRD 实施地图

User-requested LGTeacher integration (15 September 2026): the Course Management extension and its explicit remaining scope are tracked in `lgteacher-integration.md`. `CourseOutlineEditor`, `courseAuthoring` and `/api/backoffice/courses/:courseId/draft` add transactional draft section/lesson editing. This is not yet the full LGTeacher feature set.

本文件把七份 PRD 变成开发任务。它不新增产品范围。

## 1. 页面和功能

WeChat email binding is now mandatory before authenticated product access. This supersedes the earlier no-email Session acceptance described below: WeChat identity creation still supports absent email, but its session is restricted to email binding and logout until verified. Implementation: `services/emailBindingService.ts`, `services/productStore.ts`, `services/productAuth.ts`, `app/api/auth/email-binding/*`, `app/[locale]/portal/bind-email/*`. Verified binding preserves userId, checks email uniqueness twice, never merges accounts, and does not set a password. Mail and UI support both locales. Existing unbound users must bind on their next sign-in; existing unverified sessions cannot use protected APIs. Tests: `tests/integration/email-binding.spec.ts`, `tests/unit/email-binding-legal-transition.test.ts`, `tests/integration/wechat-login.spec.ts`, `tests/e2e/email-binding.spec.ts`. Real WeChat + mailbox smoke and Figma acceptance remain pending.

My Learning subscription records use Stripe product name/image and the purchased Price term (`services/subscriptionPresentationService.ts`, `services/stripePriceService.ts`, `components/portal/SubscriptionManager.tsx`). New Price snapshots include product metadata; legacy records resolve their pinned Price on the server. Orders prefer their planSnapshot over the current plan. Missing images no longer use unrelated default course artwork. Regression: `tests/integration/stripe-payment.spec.ts`. Target-environment image delivery and Figma visual acceptance remain pending.

Password reset flow: `components/portal/AuthForm.tsx` carries email/returnTo to forgot-password; `PasswordResetRequestForm.tsx` sends the request and opens `/portal/password-reset-sent` with a 60-second resend cooldown and change-email/sign-in actions. `PasswordResetConfirmForm.tsx` shows a dedicated success state, removes the used token from the address bar and preserves returnTo when signing in. DEV mail delivery is implemented in `services/passwordResetService.ts` and `services/emailService.ts`, with bilingual UI and email content. Service/API regression: `tests/integration/password-reset.spec.ts`, `tests/unit/password-reset-legal-transition.test.ts`; bilingual browser flow: `tests/e2e/password-reset.spec.ts`. Live mailbox delivery and Figma visual acceptance remain target-environment release checks.

Email Remember me: `components/portal/AuthForm.tsx` saves only the email in browser localStorage after successful checked sign-in, restores it on the next sign-in visit (including after logout), and clears it when unchecked. Explicit initial email takes precedence. Storage failures do not block authentication. Existing server session-cookie persistence is retained; no API or database migration is required. Target-environment smoke and Figma visual acceptance remain pending.

The following table remains the scope map. The product code now has a runnable product path for Portal, User Registration, User Authentication, Visitor / Trial, Purchase, Payment Management, Subscription Management, My Learning, Study, AI Tutor and the protected Course Manager/Operator path. Demo mode is available for local development; Stripe and SES are activated by environment configuration for SIT/UAT/PPE/PROD.

Email registration is implemented in `services/emailRegistration.ts`, `services/emailResend.ts`, `services/productStore.ts`, `services/emailService.ts`, `app/api/auth/register`, `app/api/auth/admin/register`, `app/api/auth/verify-email`, and `app/api/auth/resend-verification`. Email/password accounts remain pending until a one-time 24-hour verification token is accepted. Registration does not create a session before activation. The Portal check-email and verify-email pages cover resend, loading, success, invalid, expired, and already-used link states. Registration, resend, password reset and WeChat email binding store a link only after its mail is accepted; states, transitions and tests are in `docs/phase1/email-state-machine.md`. Tests: `tests/unit/register-legal-transition.test.ts`, `tests/unit/password-reset-legal-transition.test.ts`, `tests/unit/email-binding-legal-transition.test.ts`, `tests/io/login.test.ts`.

Google registration and sign-in are implemented in `services/oauthService.ts`, `app/api/auth/google`, and `app/api/auth/google/callback`. The server-side Authorization Code flow uses signed state, OIDC nonce, PKCE and verified ID Token claims. Accounts are keyed by `(provider, providerSubject)` and are never merged automatically by email.

WeChat website login is implemented in `contracts/wechat.ts`, `services/wechatOAuthService.ts`, `services/productStore.ts`, and `app/api/auth/wechat/*`. The stable subject is `appId:openid`, with UnionID stored separately. Accounts without email are supported without inventing verified addresses; Stripe Checkout omits absent customer email. Legacy identity migration preserves userId and refuses ambiguous matches. Callback success/failure clears the transaction cookie and uses localised sign-in errors. Service and Route Handler integration coverage: `tests/integration/wechat-login.spec.ts`; run `npm run test:auth`. Real QR smoke testing remains required in the target environment. This change retains the existing JSON product persistence; it does not complete the separate relational/multi-instance production migration.

## 2. Business Function 与依赖顺序

```text
Course Management
  -> Portal / Public First Lesson
  -> Pricing / Purchase
User Registration -> Subscription Management -> Payment Management
Payment Management -> Order Management + Entitlement
Entitlement -> Study + My Learning + AI Tutor
Study -> My Learning progress / current Lesson
```

`Group Study`、`Exploration`、`Reporting`、Partner 的 `Accounting`、`HR`、`BI/Dashboard` 在 Phase 1 只保留页面或接口位置，不把未给出业务规则的功能写成完成。

## 3. 不可变规则

Stripe Pricing implementation: `contracts/payment.ts`, `services/stripePriceService.ts`, `services/paymentService.ts`, `services/stripeWebhookService.ts`, `repositories/productTransactionRepository.ts`, and `components/portal/PaymentStatusRefresh.tsx`. Eight lookup keys map Everything/European Humanities/Chinese Humanities/Science to 6/12-month subscriptions. Quote/Order pin Price and Plan snapshots. PostgreSQL deployments must apply `db/migrations/009_product_payment_keys.sql` before rollout. Regression: `npm run test:payment`; isolated real test-mode Checkout and bilingual page checks: `node scripts/verify-stripe-checkout.mjs` (no card submitted). Target-domain real webhook delivery and Figma visual acceptance remain release checks.

- 只有 `published` Course、Section、Lesson 对游客可见。
- Public First Lesson 不创建完整 Course 的 Study Record。
- 完整 Course 首次打开且开始 Lesson 1 后才创建 Study Record。
- Course progress = 有效学习时间 / Course 总学习时间 × 100；只显示整数，最大 100。
- Video 和 text 不能对同一内容重复累计时间。
- `/my-learning/*` 必须有 session；失效或不存在的 Entitlement 只保留历史，不允许继续学习。
- Payment status 以 Stripe Webhook 同步结果为准；回跳页只查询结果。
- Stripe trial starts only after `checkout.session.completed`; `invoice.paid` converts the trial or records a renewal, and `invoice.payment_failed` extends access only through the configured grace period. A browser redirect never creates access.
- Production `PPE/PROD` requires `SES_FROM_EMAIL` for email verification and password reset. OAuth buttons are shown in DEV with `LOCAL_SOCIAL_LOGIN=1` and use a local provider account; PPE/PROD shows them only when the corresponding provider credentials are configured.
- The current file-backed product store is suitable for the local MVP and a single-instance DEV deployment. Before multi-instance production traffic, apply the relational migrations and move the transactional product records from `app_files` JSON to PostgreSQL tables.
- Business date/timezone、税费、6/12 month 的实际销售配置列为上线前确认项，不能由开发人员猜定。

Stripe Checkout success returns to `/{locale}/account/my-learning/subscription?orderId=...` for purchase, trial and upgrade (`services/stripeClient.ts`, `services/paymentService.ts`). The subscription page refreshes a pending owned order while awaiting webhook confirmation; refreshed subscriptions update the displayed list. Local Checkout uses the same destination. Coverage: `tests/integration/stripe-payment.spec.ts`. Target-environment smoke and visual acceptance remain pending.

Login source navigation: `lib/authNavigation.ts` and `components/portal/AuthNavigationLink.tsx` add an encoded `returnTo` to Portal header login/registration and FAQ login links, retaining pathname, query and hash. Auth-page switches retain the original source. Existing sign-in validation and email/OAuth flows consume that parameter. Tests: `tests/unit/auth-navigation.test.ts`, `tests/e2e/E2E-B1-visitor-auth.spec.ts`. Target-environment smoke and Figma acceptance remain pending.
