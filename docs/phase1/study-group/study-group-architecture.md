# Study Group architecture

Design for Oliver Zhang. Sources are PRD v0.10, the locked decisions below, and branch `cursor/study-group-backend-7481` at `18a1046ec71853f77d1b73eda545526c58964826` ([PR 37](https://github.com/LibertychaserUS/LearningGuidePortal/pull/37)). Diagrams are in `study-group-uml.md`. Technology choices are in `study-group-tech-selection.md`. The later AI Tutor phase is in `study-group-ai-tutor-plan.md`. Later closed choices are in `decisions.md`.

## Closed decisions

- Chat stays in LiveKit. No chat row.
- One meeting record per meeting. No token audit table. One encrypted log line per issuance. The line has no raw token and no API secret.
- A Live Session holds at most 6 people including the Host. The Host sets the Session maximum from 2 to 6. Admission is first come, first served by the time the server receives the enter request.
- AI Tutor does not run this phase. The Live Session stores the enabled flag. The queue in this design is per Live Session only. An item is the user id, the session id, the text, and the server receipt time. One question for that Session is in flight at a time, in server receipt order. A later question does not cancel or merge with an earlier one. An answer is tied to the asker and the original text. There is no per-user tutor identity and no course-wide tutor identity. Whether the tutor is one per user or one shared by a Course is not decided. Answers may use only course context that a later design supplies. The shape of that context is open. How the knowledge base is built, the structure of the base, and the structure of a piece of knowledge are not decided. No schema, table, or sample content is added for that base. The model call is direct, through a lightweight distributed service with a pool of API keys. The model vendor is not chosen. How a reply re-enters LiveKit is not chosen. Chat stays in LiveKit. The system prompt is a server-side constant and is not sent to the browser.
- The Host manages the Group only outside the room. In the room the Host has the same permissions as a participant. The LiveKit token has no Host label.
- Session Title is required and is at most 20 characters. That is the Figma counter `7/20` on frame `599:1806`. The longer sample title on that frame is not the limit. PRD v0.10 does not state another length. The branch still rejects a Session Title over 80 characters in `scheduleSession` and `editSession`, and the schedule input has no `maxLength`.
- Planned duration is required. The Host chooses 30, 45, 60, or 90 minutes. Those choices are stored as 1800, 2700, 3600, and 5400 seconds. There is no other duration. The Figma session card shows `45 mins`. Branch `18a1046` still stores `durationMinutes` and accepts any integer of at least 1.

## Layers

| Layer | Owns |
|---|---|
| UI | Study Groups pages, forms, Session Full, Waiting for Host Start, and the room. Sends HTTP. Connects to LiveKit with the returned token. Sends Chat and Raise Hand as LiveKit data. Does not decide Course access, capacity, or the token grants. |
| Route Handler | Parses the body, reads the session, calls the application service, returns `{ ok, code, message, data }`. |
| Application service | Course access, Host and Member rules, Session state, the 2–6 cap, request-time order, meeting creation, token signing, the encrypted line, seat release when signing fails, and appending one tutor-queue item. It does not call a model. |
| Repository | Study Group, membership, Live Session, attendance intent, presence, the one meeting row, reminders, the issuance log line, and the session-scoped tutor queue. Nothing in this phase reads that queue. |
| LiveKit | The room, audio, video, screen share, presence on the wire, and data messages, including Chat. It does not store Group rows, it does not count seats, and it does not drain the tutor queue. |

Course access is read from Entitlement. Group Study does not write Entitlement. Notifications for cancel-group and the T-10 reminder go through the existing notification and mail services. The service decides who is in the audience.

## Request path

A signed-in learner opens `/[locale]/portal/study-groups`. The page calls `GET /api/study-groups?view=mine|discover|courses` and `GET /api/study-groups/:groupId`.

Create, edit, cancel, join, and leave the Group are HTTP calls into `modules/group-study`. Schedule, plan, cancel attendance, enter, start, leave, and token are the same. The room page is `/[locale]/portal/study-groups/sessions/:sessionId`. It polls the Session, and once the Session is Live it asks for a token and connects.

Enter and token are separate requests. Enter is the seat grant. Token is the credential. The browser never sees the LiveKit API secret.

## What is stored

| Record | Kept | Not kept |
|---|---|---|
| Study Group | Id, title, one Course id, about, Host user id, `active` or `cancelled`, timestamps. Course id does not change. | Group-level date, duration, lesson, or a six-person cap. |
| Membership | Group, user, `host` or `member`, joined and left times. Many members. | A seat in a Live Session. |
| Live Session | Title (at most 20 characters), optional Related Lesson, start, planned duration as 1800, 2700, 3600, or 5400 seconds (30, 45, 60, or 90 minutes), maximum 2–6, optional focus, AI Tutor flag, `scheduled`, `live`, `completed`, or `removed`. | A Cancelled card. `removed` drops it from lists. Any other duration. |
| Attendance intent | Plan to Attend time, or cancelled time. | A reserved seat. |
| Presence | Request time, entered time, left time, `waiting` or `live`. This is the seat and the actual-attendance record. | Plan to Attend by itself. |
| Meeting | One row when the Host starts that Session. `startedAt`, and `endedAt` when the last participant leaves after start. A second Start does not insert another row. | A row at schedule time. A token. |
| Reminder | One sent mark per Session and user, for the Host and for members who still Plan to Attend. | A reminder to every Group member. |
| Issuance log | One encrypted line per successful issuance: user id, role, session id, `token_issued`, time. | The raw token, the API secret, a token table. |
| Tutor queue | Session-scoped items only. Each item is user id, session id, text, and server receipt time. | A reply, a model name, Course Knowledge, screen bytes, a seat change, or a token. Nothing drains the queue. |
| LiveKit room | Media and Chat while people are connected. | A database copy of Chat, a recording, or screen pixels for AI Tutor. |

The selected store is PostgreSQL. The branch repository still writes `study-group.json` and `token-issuance.log` on the local file store.

## State

Group membership, for one user: Discoverable, then Joined, or Hosting from create. Leave returns a member to Discoverable while the Group stays active. The Host does not leave. Cancel Group is terminal for the pages. Completed Session rows stay in the store. The cancelled Group is not listed.

Live Session: Scheduled, then Starting Soon at T-10, then Live only when the Host starts, then Completed when the last participant leaves after start. Cancel before start removes the record. The scheduled clock and the planned duration do not start or complete the Session. Waiting for Host Start is the member's page during Starting Soon, not a second Session state. People on that page count toward occupancy. Host Start moves them into the room without another enter, and the count stays.

A Group card Live badge means some child Session is Live. It is not a Group state.

## Atomic steps

Each user operation that changes a seat, a meeting, a token, or the log is split below. The service orders the steps. The repository commits the row change. LiveKit is not in the seat or meeting write.

**Enter.** The service checks the session, membership, Course access, and Starting Soon or Live. It orders concurrent enters by server receipt time. The repository grants one presence if occupancy is still under the Session maximum. A duplicate enter for someone already seated does not add a row. The seventh person when the maximum is 6 gets Session Full and no row.

**Host Start.** The service checks the Host and Starting Soon. The repository sets the Session to Live, moves waiting presences to the live phase, and inserts one meeting row if that Session does not have one. Occupancy is unchanged. This step does not sign a token.

**Token.** The service reads the seat. It signs a participant token with no Host label. If signing fails, the repository releases that seat, and no log line is written. If signing succeeds, the repository appends one encrypted line that contains neither the token nor the API secret, and the Route returns the token. The UI then connects to LiveKit.

**Leave.** The repository sets `leftAt`. If the Session is Live and occupancy is then zero, the Session becomes Completed and the meeting row gets `endedAt`.

**Tutor queue append.** The service records one item for that Session: user id, session id, text, and the time the server received it. The repository stores the item. No step reads it, deletes it, or sends it to a model, to Course Knowledge, or to a screen parser. This append is not part of enter, Host Start, token issuance, or leave. Occupancy and the token are unchanged.

The system prompt for a later call is server-side only. The browser does not receive it. A later call may pass course context beside the item text. That context's shape is open. The prompt allows a course fact only when it is in the context passed with that call. Participant text cannot override that. The screen is not parsed.

The call is direct. No agent framework is added. The call layer is a lightweight distributed service. It keeps a pool of API keys, switches to another key on auth failure, rate limit, or quota, records request count, errors, and latency per key, and sends traffic only to healthy keys. Raw keys are never logged, never put in the repo, and never sent to the browser. The model vendor is not chosen. How a reply re-enters LiveKit is not chosen.

The queue is per Live Session only. One question is in flight at a time, in server receipt order. A later question does not cancel or merge with an earlier one. The answer is tied to the asker and the original text. This design does not add a per-user tutor identity or a course-wide tutor identity. Whether the tutor is one per user or one shared by a Course is not decided. How the knowledge base is built, the structure of the base, and the structure of a piece of knowledge are not decided.

On branch `18a1046`, `enterSession` writes the presence and returns. `issueToken` does not clear that presence when signing fails. The atomic step above is the design. The branch has not combined them. The branch stores the AI Tutor flag and has no tutor queue.

## Emergency behavior the PRD already states

- Missing required fields on create are blocked at the field.
- Invalid Course access blocks Join and Join Now, and the page offers the Course access path.
- A full Session blocks another enter and shows Session Full. Plan to Attend does not override that.
- A member who planned to attend and finds the Session full stays blocked.
- A network drop may be restored by LiveKit reconnect. The Session stays Live while anyone remains. Host disconnect has no grace and does not end the Session.
- After Host Start, the last participant leaving sets Completed.
- Host cancel of an unstarted Session removes it from the lists.
- Host cancel of the Group makes it inaccessible, cancels upcoming Sessions, removes it from My and Discover, notifies members, and keeps completed Session rows in the store.
- Enter during Starting Soon shows Waiting for Host Start and counts toward capacity. The scheduled time does not start the Session. People already waiting stay on that page until Host Start or cancel.
- The LiveKit API secret stays on the server. The browser receives only the short-lived token for that user and that Session.

## PRD coverage

Verdicts are against PRD v0.10 on branch `18a1046`. `meets` means the branch does what that sentence says. `misses` means the sentence is not done. `contradicts` means the branch does the opposite.

### Success criteria

| ID | Specified | Branch | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| SC-001 | A signed-in learner with Course access creates a Group and becomes Host. | meets | `createGroup` checks access and writes role `host`. |
| SC-002 | The Group is discoverable to people who have not joined, including people without Course access. | meets | Discover allows a null user and does not check Entitlement. |
| SC-003 | Valid Course access joins immediately, with no Host approval. | meets | `joinGroup` inserts membership. |
| SC-004 | No Course access cannot join and is sent to get access. | meets | Join returns `course_access_required`. The page links to the Course. |
| SC-005 | Membership is larger than six. The six-person limit is per Live Session. | meets | Join has no cap. Enter uses `maxParticipants`. |
| SC-006 | Host can schedule, edit, cancel, and start an eligible Live Session. | misses | Schedule, cancel, and start exist. Edit is an API that changes title only, and the page has no Edit Session control. |
| SC-007 | Plan to Attend and Cancel Attendance do not reserve a place. | meets | Intent rows are separate from presence. |
| SC-008 | A Live Session supports 2–6 concurrent participants including the Host. | meets | Schedule accepts 2–6. Occupancy counts entered people, including a Host who has entered. |
| SC-009 | Live participants share the same in-room controls for their own media, screen share, Chat, Raise Hand, and Leave. | misses | The control list does not vary by role. Mic, camera, and share only call the enable path, and the room does not render a media element. |
| SC-010 | When AI Tutor is enabled, any live participant can invoke it in shared Chat. | misses | The flag is stored. The room has no tutor invoke. The design seam is an undrained queue. The branch does not have that queue. |
| SC-011 | AI Tutor follows Course AI Tutor and Course Knowledge, and does not parse the shared screen. | misses | No tutor call exists, so the screen is not parsed. The grounding behavior is not implemented. |
| SC-012 | The Session becomes Completed after the final participant leaves. | meets | After start, occupancy zero sets `completed`. |
| SC-013 | From T-10, joined members may enter and wait, and they count toward occupancy before Host Start. | meets | `effectiveSessionState` and `enterSession`. |

### Business rules

| ID | Specified | Branch | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| BR-001 | A Group links to exactly one Course. | meets | `courseId` is one field. |
| BR-002 | The Course is immutable after create. | meets | Edit rejects a different `courseId`. |
| BR-003 | Create lists only Courses the user can access. | meets | `listCreatableCourses` filters with Entitlement. |
| BR-004 | A new Group is publicly discoverable. | meets | Active groups are listed in discover. |
| BR-005 | Discover excludes Groups the user has joined or hosts. | meets | `listDiscover` skips active memberships. |
| BR-006 | A Group Live badge means a child Session is Live. | meets | `groupIsLive` uses child state `live` only. |
| BR-007 | Only valid Course access may join. No Host approval. | meets | `joinGroup`. |
| BR-008 | Membership is not limited by the six-person cap. | meets | No cap on join. |
| BR-009 | The member list is scrollable and can hold many members. | meets | All active members render. The page can scroll. The member column has no inner scroller. |
| BR-010 | Host may edit title and about. Course cannot be edited. | meets | Edit form and `editGroup`. |
| BR-011 | Cancel Group makes it unavailable, removes it from lists, cancels upcoming Sessions, notifies members, and keeps completed history in the store. | meets | Status `cancelled`, scheduled Sessions `removed`, in-site notify, completed rows kept. |
| BR-012 | Each Live Session supports 2–6 including the Host. | meets | Validation and occupancy. |
| BR-013 | Related Lesson is optional metadata and need not show on P0 cards. | misses | Cards omit it. The schedule control does not submit `relatedLessonId`, so a lesson cannot be saved. A blank lesson still schedules. |
| BR-014 | AI Tutor defaults on and can be turned off before start. | meets | `aiTutorEnabled !== false`, checkbox default checked. |
| BR-015 | Starting Soon begins at T-10. Entry waits for the Host. The clock does not start the Session. | meets | `STARTING_SOON_MS` and `startSession`. |
| BR-016 | Edit and Cancel are available only before the Session starts. | misses | Cancel is offered through Starting Soon and refused after Live. Edit is not offered on the page. |
| BR-017 | Cancel removes the record. No Cancelled card. | meets | Status `removed`, filtered out of views. |
| BR-018 | Plan to Attend never reserves a live place. | meets | Intent is not occupancy. |
| BR-019 | Host and Plan-to-Attend members get a reminder at T-10 by in-site notification and email. Cancelling attendance removes the member reminder. | misses | Audience and both channels exist inside `dispatchDueReminders`. That function runs when My Study Groups is loaded, not from a clock. |
| BR-020 | A joined member may enter from T-10 without Plan to Attend, if capacity and Course access allow, and sees Waiting for Host Start. | meets | Enter ignores intent. The page shows the waiting dialog. |
| BR-021 | At capacity, further entry is blocked and the UI shows Session Full. | meets | `session_full` and a disabled Session full control. |
| BR-022 | Participant and Host can view Completed history. | meets | Completed rows stay in the member Session list and are read-only apart from view attendees. |
| BR-023 | Leaving cancels future Plan to Attend and reminders. The Group can be discovered again. | meets | `leaveGroup` cancels scheduled intents. Discover lists the user again. |
| BR-024 | In the room, Host and participants have equal controls. The Host label is identity only. | meets | Live controls ignore role. The badge comes from membership, not from the token. |
| BR-025 | Raise Hand needs no approval and does not change speaking permission. | meets | A LiveKit data message. No grant change. |
| BR-026 | Leave Session exits only that user. The Session stays Live while someone remains. | meets | `leaveSession`. |
| BR-027 | The final participant leaving completes the Session. | meets | Only after the Session is Live. |
| BR-028 | No Host-disconnect grace or Host-leave auto-end. | meets | Those paths are absent. |
| BR-029 | Any current participant may invoke the tutor in shared Chat when it is enabled. | misses | No invoke path. |
| BR-030 | Answers and questions follow Course AI Tutor and Course Knowledge. | misses | No tutor call. |
| BR-031 | The tutor does not parse the shared screen. | meets | Nothing sends screen content to a tutor. |
| BR-032 | Course access is revalidated before Join Study Group and Join Live Session. | meets | `joinGroup` and `enterSession` call `hasCourseAccess`. |
| BR-033 | A waiting entrant counts toward occupancy. Plan to Attend alone does not. | meets | Occupancy is open presences. |
| BR-034 | Host Start moves waiting people into Live without another join, and the count stays. | meets | Phase update plus the waiting poll navigating to the room. |

### Pages and fields

| Specified | Branch | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| GS-HOME-001 No selection shows My, Discover, and a prompt to select or create. | meets | Empty pane copy and both lists. |
| GS-HOME-002 My contains Joined and Hosted Groups, visually distinct. | meets | Badges Hosted and Joined. |
| GS-HOME-003 Discover contains Groups the user has neither joined nor hosted. No duplicate across the two lists. | meets | `listDiscover` and `listMine`. |
| GS-HOME-004 Discover filters by Course and keyword. | meets | `courseId` and `q`. |
| GS-HOME-005 A Live badge on a Group card when a child Session is Live. | misses | My cards show it. Discover cards do not. |
| Create requires Title, Related Course, and About. Course choices are those with access. Create assigns the Host and makes the Group discoverable. Cancel writes nothing. | meets | Create form and `createGroup`. |
| GS-CREATE-006 Success shows a confirmation with title and Course. | misses | Copy keys exist. Create opens the Group directly. |
| GS-CREATE-007 The creator is already Host. No second save. | meets | Membership is written in create. |
| GS-CREATE-008 Go to Study Group opens the Host view. | misses | There is no confirmation action. The Host view opens immediately from create. |
| Host detail shows Hosting, read-only Course, about, members, and no-session copy. Schedule, Edit Group, and Cancel Group are Host actions. Cancel asks for confirmation. | meets | Host column and `window.confirm`. |
| Schedule requires title, date, start time, duration, and maximum 2–6. Related Lesson and focus are optional. AI Tutor defaults on. Scheduling does not remind every member. | meets | The form requires a duration and `scheduleSession` requires an integer of at least 1. The branch stores that integer as `durationMinutes` and does not limit it to 30, 45, 60, or 90 minutes, or to 1800, 2700, 3600, and 5400 seconds. The lesson dropdown has no options and is not submitted. |
| Host list shows Starting Soon, occupancy for entered people, edit and cancel before start, plan count, view attendees, completed history, and another schedule action. | misses | Those states and actions exist except Edit Session, which is not on the page. |
| GS-JOIN-001 through GS-JOIN-005 Overview and members before join, Sessions hidden, Join enabled with Course access, immediate join, Group moves to My. | meets | `sessions` is null until membership. Join banner is shown. |
| GS-ACCESS-001 through GS-ACCESS-005 Discover without Course access, overview and members visible, Sessions hidden, Join unavailable, Get Course access, then the normal not-joined state after access. | meets | `canJoin` false links to the Course page. |
| Joined detail shows Starting Soon, Live occupancy, Session Full, Plan to Attend, Cancel Attendance, completed history, and Leave Study Group. | meets | Session cards and leave. |
| Waiting page after enter during Starting Soon. The user counts toward capacity. Host Start moves them without another join. | meets | Waiting dialog, presence row, poll, then the room. The branch uses a dialog on the Group page rather than a separate route. |
| Room shows a Host badge with no moderation, own mic and camera, screen share, participants, shared Chat, Raise Hand, and Leave. No mute-others, remove, Invite to Speak, End Session, or Host grace. | misses | Badge, Chat, Raise Hand, and Leave match. Media controls do not toggle off and do not show the shared screen as the main area. The forbidden Host controls are absent. |

### State model

| Specified | Branch | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Not joined can view overview and members, then Join. | meets | `getGroup`. |
| Joined can view Sessions, plan, enter, and leave. | meets | Member actions. |
| Hosting adds edit, cancel, schedule, and start, and still has member actions. | meets | Role checks. The Host plan button is not on the page. The Host still receives the reminder without planning. |
| Cancelled Group has no member access. | meets | Active-only reads. |
| Scheduled allows Host edit and cancel, and member plan. Entry is closed. | meets | `session_not_open` before T-10. |
| Starting Soon allows enter and wait, and Host start, edit, and cancel, until Start. No auto-start. | misses | Enter, start, and cancel match. Edit is missing on the page. |
| Live allows enter while capacity remains, with equal room controls. | meets | Enter in `live`. Room controls do not add Host moderation. |
| Completed is read-only history after the last leave, with actual attendees. | meets | `showActual` uses presences. No start, edit, or cancel. |
| Plan to Attend creates intent and reminder eligibility and does not reserve capacity. Cancel Attendance removes them. | meets | Intent rows and reminder audience. |
| Join Now from T-10 is independent of Plan to Attend. | meets | Enter does not read intent. |
