# Registration and Authentication

Black-box I/O against `/api/auth/*` and one protected purchase gate. Not a mirror of the Registration PRD.
Suite is armed. Overlay select runs this product_command.

Shallow to deep: public JSON shape → production leak → role → password takeover → session kick.

## AUTH-01 Email enumeration


### Functional
- Title: check-email does not distinguish a known address
- Steps: Register; POST /api/auth/check-email for that address and for an unknown address
- Expected: Same HTTP status; no `exists` field; same public JSON shape


### Negative
- Title: Register copy and pending login do not leak
- Steps: Register the same email twice; sign in a pending address and a missing address
- Expected: Second register does not say "already exists"; pending login is not 403-only; same public shape as a missing address


### Edge
- Title: Resend does not 429 only for a pending address
- Steps: POST /api/auth/resend-verification for a pending address, a missing address, and the pending address again
- Expected: Same status and public shape; never 429 only for pending
- Title: Active, pending, and unknown check-email share one public shape
- Steps: Register an active account and a pending account; POST check-email for both and for an unknown address
- Expected: No `exists` field; the three public JSON shapes match
- Title: check-email after a failed login still has no exists field
- Steps: Sign in with a wrong password; POST check-email for that address and an unknown address
- Expected: No `exists`; same public shape
- Title: A second pending register does not say the address already exists
- Steps: Register pending; register the same email again
- Expected: HTTP 200; copy has no "already exists"
- Title: Missing and unknown verify-email tokens share a public failure
- Steps: POST /api/auth/verify-email `{}` and `{ token: "unknown" }`
- Expected: Both HTTP 400; no `exists`; no token leak
## AUTH-02 Password-reset leak

- Steps: POST reset twice for the same known email
- Expected: Both HTTP 200; no `resetUrl` or `token=`; same public shape
- Title: Pending and unknown password-reset share one public shape
- Steps: POST reset for a pending address and an unknown address
- Expected: Both HTTP 200; same public JSON
- Title: A failed sign-in JSON has no resetUrl or token
- Steps: POST sign-in with the wrong password
- Expected: HTTP 401; no `resetUrl` or `token=`
- Title: Confirm without a token or with a garbage token leaks nothing
- Steps: POST /api/auth/password-reset/confirm with no token, then with a random token
- Expected: Both HTTP 400; `ok: false`; no `resetUrl` or `token=`

Specified / not tested now (prose, not a function_id): AUTH-04 Google signup promotion has no live OAuth path. Local Google uses a fixed fixture email, not the operator address.
