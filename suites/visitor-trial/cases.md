# Visitor / Trial

Black-box I/O against trial quote, `/api/trial`, demo confirm, entitlement check, study/events, and `/api/subscription` resume.
Suite is draft. Overlay select does not run this product_command until a human arms it.

Visitor-facing checks are TRIAL-01 / TRIAL-02 (unique ids; payment suite keeps PAY-01 / PAY-10). Trial Canceled → Trial Active before the original `trial_end` must not extend `validTo` (`domain-model.md`).

## TRIAL-01 Trial activation


### Functional
- Title: Completed demo trial grants visitor access inside three days
- Steps: Sign in; POST trial quote; POST /api/trial; POST demo confirm `complete`; GET /api/entitlements/check
- Expected: Confirm 200 `paid`; `allowed` true; `source` is trial; `validTo` stays inside the 3-day window


### Negative
- Title: Cancelling checkout never grants the course
- Steps: Same trial checkout; POST confirm `cancel`; GET entitlements; POST /api/study/events on a locked lesson
- Expected: Order `canceled`; entitlement false; study/events 403
- Title: Unauthenticated trial is 401
- Steps: POST /api/trial with no cookie
- Expected: HTTP 401; `ok: false`; no order; INV-unauth-no-grant


### Edge
- Title: Resume trial_canceled inside the original window does not extend validTo
- Steps: Complete trial; record `validTo`; POST /api/subscription `cancel`; POST `resume`; GET entitlements
- Expected: Cancel removes access; resume is Trial Active; `validTo` equals the original trial end. Matches Trial Canceled → Trial Active before original `trial_end`, no extension. If resume is 400, keep this intended assertion (do not weaken)
- Title: Second trial start while live does not extend validTo
- Steps: Complete trial; POST trial quote + /api/trial again; complete again
- Expected: Same order id; entitlement `source=trial`; `validTo` unchanged
- Title: Trial expiry at validTo denies check and study writes
- Steps: Complete trial; set entitlement.validTo to now; GET entitlements/check; POST study/events on a locked lesson
- Expected: `allowed` false; study/events 403; INV-expired-no-learn
## TRIAL-02 Cancelled trial does not revive


### Functional
- Title: Completed demo trial allows the course
- Steps: Covered by TRIAL-01 functional (`tests/io/visitor-trial.test.ts`)
- Expected: Confirm 200; entitlement allowed


### Negative
- Title: Second complete after trial cancel does not grant
- Steps: Complete trial; POST subscription cancel; GET entitlements; POST /api/study/events on a locked lesson; POST confirm `complete` again
- Expected: Entitlement false; study/events 403; second complete 400; entitlement stays false (TRIAL-02 / PAY-10)


### Edge
- Title: Trial checkout without consents
- Steps: Specified in `tests/io/payment.test.ts` PAY-10 edge; visitor path is TRIAL-02
- Expected: HTTP 400
- Title: Trial after a paid purchase does not grant
- Steps: Purchase the course; POST trial quote + /api/trial
- Expected: HTTP 400; entitlement `source` stays purchase; INV-one-charge
